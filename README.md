# Lib_c:  
During my first year at Epitech in 2021, I started to learn the c language by rewriting functions that could be useful throughout the year because we were not allowed to use most of the functions created in c. Here are the functions I had to redo:
- my_swap (it allows to exchange two values ​​between them)
- my_strupcase (it allows you to put the string passed as a parameter in uppercase)
- my_strstr (it allows to search for the first occurrence of a substring in the main string)
- my_strncpy (it allows to copy n element of a string in another string)
- my_strncmp (it allows to compare the first n elements of two strings)
- my_strncat (it allows to concatenate the first n elements of a character string in another)
- my_strlowcase (it allows to put the string pass in lowercase parameter)
- my_strlen (it allows to count the number of character of the string that we pass in parameter)
- my_strdup (it allows you to allocate a new memory area via the malloc function in order to copy the character string passed as a parameter)
- my_strcpy (it allows to copy a string)
- my_strcmp (it allows to compare two strings between them)
- my_strcat (it allows you to concatenate two strings together)
- my_strcapitalize (it allows you to put the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase)
- my_str_to_word_array (it allows to split a string into an array of strings according to a separator character passed as a parameter)
- my_str_isupper (it allows to test if a string is completely in uppercase letter)
- my_str_isprintable (it allows to know if the string passed in parameter is displayable)
- my_str_isnume (it allows to know if the character string passed in parameter is composed only of number or not)
- my_str_islower (it allows to test if a string is completely in lowercase letter)
- my_str_isalpha (it allows to test if a string is completely composed of letters)
- my_revstr (it allows to reverse the integer of a string)
- my_putstr (it allows to display a string on the standard output)
- my_putchar (it allows to display a character on the standard output)
- my_put_nbr (it allows to display numbers on the standard output)
- my_isneg (it allows to know if the number is negative or positive)
- my_getnbr (it allows to change a string from number to int)
- my_compute_square_root (it allows to know the square root of the number passed in parameter)
- my_compute_power_rec (it lets you know the power of a number passed as a parameter)
